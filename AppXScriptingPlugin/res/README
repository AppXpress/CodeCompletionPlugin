The purpose of this plugin is to help the developer with scripting on the AppXpress platform. This is a work in progress and the source code for the plugin is freely available for modification at https://github.com/orgs/AppXpress/CodeCompletionPlugin.

Plugin Features:

The project setup wizard has the following features..
- Connects to AppXpress platform and fetches the list of available standard documents and custom objects for scripting
- Generates a skeleton platform module script for the selected document/object
- The generated script includes developer libraries with javascript representation of the selected documents/custom objects for scripting.
- Get hints to the attributes of standard documents and custom objects while coding in the Javascript perspective.

Limitations:
- Doesn't support the following attribute types : PICKLIST, ROOTTYPE
- Doesn't show READONLY attribute of objects (not all attributes visible are editable in the system).

Example code:

function objectOnCreateFunction(obj, event, params){
	var HelloQ5Obj = new HelloQ5();
	HelloQ5Obj = obj;
	//TODO: HelloQ5Obj property get/set goes here..
	HelloQ5Obj.helloId = new Date().getTime();
	Providers.getPersistenceProvider().save(HelloQ5Obj);
}
